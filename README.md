# Hi, Thanks for Checking Out My Personal Site! 🍌🍌🍌

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## If you like what you see, feel free to clone the repository and use it as a template

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm i` followed by `npm start` and boom you are up and running!


## Make it your own

I used css variables in the index.css root section so you can easily change out the colors.
You'll need to set up an account with EmailJs and update the credentials if you want the form to work on your site!
